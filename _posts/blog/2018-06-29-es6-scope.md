# ES6 Variable Scope
---
`var`, `let`, `const`

### let
---
If a variable is declared using `let`, the declared variable is only accessable in that block or statement. `let` is most useful in loops. Examples:

Example 1:

```javascript
let age = 29;
if (true) {
  let age = 11;
  console.log(age);
}
console.log(age);
```

Example 2:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i >= 3; i++)
```

### const
---
If a variable is declared using `const`, the declared variable is accessable locally and globaly. `const` is immutable, meaning the variable cannot be changed. Examples:

```javascript
const age = 29; // 29
const age = 11; // error
```
