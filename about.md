#### Hello! My name is Glenn Lanzer III and I'm from and currently reside in the beautiful city of Dallas, Texas. People tend to think all Texans are cowboys and whatnot, however that's far from the truth. This is an enormous city. The DFW area consists of Dallas, Fort Worth, Denton, Arlington, Lewisville, and many other cities all within a consideribly small amount of land space. The last I checked, the population of the DFW area was about 7 million. With that random knowledge being said, I'm mostly a city boy but the country is not too far away! I'm 28-years old, about to turn 29 at the end of the month.

#### Currently for work (available for hire), I'm a Full-stack Web Developer with experience in the following languages and frameworks:
  * ###### *JavaScript*, *React*, *Angular*, *TypeScript*, *MongoDB*, *MySQL*, *Python*, *Ruby*, *Jekyll*, *Ruby on Rails*, *Java*, *Kotlin*
#### and tools such as:
  * ###### *Git*, *PowerShell*, *WSL*, *GitHub*, *Babel*, *ESLint*, *Gulp*
#### and much more. I love open-source and try my best to contribute to it.

#### I enjoy to learn about many different subjects. In my blog, I am going to inject my learnings as well as any method to learning I may have found upon the way that could help you learn smarter and faster.
